# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game is played between two players, who take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Requirements

To run this game, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. No other dependencies are required.

How to play

To play the game, run the tic_tac_toe.py file in your Python environment. You will be prompted to enter your names and choose your markers (X or O).

The game will start, and you will take turns placing your markers on the board. To place a marker, enter the number corresponding to the position you want to mark (1-9).

If you get three of your markers in a row, you win! If all the spaces on the board are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.

At the end of each game, you will be asked if you want to play again.

Implementation

The game is implemented using a simple console-based user interface. The board is represented as a list of strings, with each string representing a row on the board. The players' markers are represented as strings ('X' or 'O').

The game logic is implemented using a series of functions. These functions check for a win condition, determine the player's move, and check for a full board.
